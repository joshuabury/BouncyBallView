# BouncyBallView

Custom drawn UIView that animates a bouncing ball with haptic feedback. 

Includes a gesture recognizer (UITapGestureRecognizer) to reset the ball when the view is tapped and a UIImpactFeedbackGenerator to provide haptic feedback when the ball hits the sides of the view (on supported devices).
